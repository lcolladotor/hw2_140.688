	volume = {23},

	doi = {10.1091/mbc.E11-06-0530},
	abstract = {The coordination of {RNA} polymerase I transcription with pre-{rRNA} processing, preribosomal particle assembly, and nuclear export is a finely tuned process requiring the concerted actions of a number of accessory factors. However, the exact functions of some of these proteins and how they assemble in subcomplexes remain poorly defined. {LAS1L} was first described as a nucleolar protein required for maturation of the {60S} preribosomal subunit. In this paper, we demonstrate that {LAS1L} interacts with {PELP1}, {TEX10}, and {WDR18}, the mammalian homologues of the budding yeast Rix1 complex, along with {NOL9} and {SENP3}, to form a novel nucleolar complex that cofractionates with the {60S} preribosomal subunit. Depletion of {LAS1L-associated} proteins results in a p53-dependent G1 arrest and leads to defects in processing of the pre-{rRNA} internal transcribed spacer 2 region. We further show that the nucleolar localization of this complex requires active {RNA} polymerase I transcription and the small ubiquitin-like modifier-specific protease {SENP3.} Taken together, our data identify a novel mammalian complex required for {60S} ribosomal subunit synthesis, providing further insight into the intricate, yet poorly described, process of ribosome biogenesis in higher eukaryotes.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0003964},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Previous studies of brain and peripheral tissues in schizophrenia patients have indicated impaired energy supply to the brain. A number of studies have also demonstrated dysfunction of the microvasculature in schizophrenia patients. Together these findings are consistent with a hypothesis of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in schizophrenia. In this study, we have investigated the cerebral vascular endothelium of schizophrenia patients at the level of transcriptomics.
{METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS:} We used laser capture microdissection to isolate both microvascular endothelial cells and neurons from post mortem brain tissue from schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. {RNA} was isolated from these cell populations, amplified, and analysed using two independent microarray platforms, Affymetrix {HG133plus2.0} {GeneChips} and {CodeLink} Whole Human Genome arrays. In the first instance, we used the dataset to compare the neuronal and endothelial data, in order to demonstrate that the predicted differences between cell types could be detected using this methodology. We then compared neuronal and endothelial data separately between schizophrenic subjects and controls. Analysis of the endothelial samples showed differences in gene expression between schizophrenics and controls which were reproducible in a second microarray platform. Functional profiling revealed that these changes were primarily found in genes relating to inflammatory processes.
{CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:} This study provides preliminary evidence of molecular alterations of the cerebral microvasculature in schizophrenia patients, suggestive of a hypo-inflammatory state in this tissue type. Further investigation of the blood-brain barrier in schizophrenia is warranted.},

We performed a genome-wide association study of 3,322 European individuals with schizophrenia and 3,587 controls. Here we show, using two analytic approaches, the extent to which common genetic variation underlies the risk of schizophrenia. First, we implicate the major histocompatibility complex. Second, we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of schizophrenia involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. We show that this component also contributes to the risk of bipolar disorder, but not to several non-psychiatric diseases.},

	issn = {1563-5260},
	doi = {10.3109/01677063.2014.882918},
	abstract = {Disrupted synchronized oscillatory firing of pyramidal neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex in the gamma frequency band (i.e., 30-100 Hz) mediates many of the cognitive deficits and symptoms of schizophrenia. In fact, the density of dendritic spines and the average somal area of pyramidal neurons in layer 3 of the cerebral cortex, which mediate both long-range (associational) and local (intrinsic) corticocortical connections, are decreased in subjects with this illness. To explore the molecular pathophysiology of pyramidal neuronal dysfunction, we extracted ribonucleic acid ({RNA)} from laser-captured pyramidal neurons from layer 3 of Brodmann's area 42 of the superior temporal gyrus ({STG)} from postmortem brains from schizophrenia and normal control subjects. We then profiled the messenger {RNA} ({mRNA)} expression of these neurons, using microarray technology. We identified 1331 {mRNAs} that were differentially expressed in schizophrenia, including genes that belong to the transforming growth factor beta ({TGF-β)} and the bone morphogenetic proteins ({BMPs)} signaling pathways. Disturbances of these signaling mechanisms may in part contribute to the altered expression of other genes found to be differentially expressed in this study, such as those that regulate extracellular matrix ({ECM)}, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal and synaptic plasticity. In addition, we identified 10 {microRNAs} ({miRNAs)} that were differentially expressed in schizophrenia; enrichment analysis of their predicted gene targets revealed signaling pathways and gene networks that were found by microarray to be dysregulated, raising an interesting possibility that dysfunction of pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia may in part be mediated by a concerted dysregulation of gene network functions as a result of the altered expression of a relatively small number of {miRNAs.} Taken together, findings of this study provide a neurobiological framework within which specific hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of pyramidal cell dysfunction in schizophrenia can be formulated.},
